## Features

- Efficient C++ implementations of common coding schemes:
  - Convolutional Codes
- Channel models:
  - AWGN
  - Fading *(planned)*
- Python bindings via [pybind11](https://github.com/pybind/pybind11)
- Python utilities for:
  - Bit Error Rate (BER) analysis
- Unit testing with `pytest`
